## Web Component Implementation of choiceInteraction

Prototype implementation by Jennifer Grant and Mark Hakkinen - Educational Testing Service

This is an initial prototype implementation of a QTI choiceInteraction [1] implemented using the W3C Web Components Technology [2].  It is feature incomplete and not meant to represent a definitive approach to using Web Components for representing QTI elements in HTML.

The implementation uses Google's Polymer Library to implement the component [3].

aqtidemo.html is your starting point.  It contains both the polymer definition of the qti-choiceInteraction, as well as the usage of the component in HTML.  Use chrome, as we have found polymers' cross platform behavior problematic.

You can try out a working demo here [4].
